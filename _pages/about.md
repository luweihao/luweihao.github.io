# About me
------
I am a Ph.D. graduate from the Department of Statistics and Data Science, Tsinghua University. I was extremely fortunate to be advised by Associate Professor [Qian Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/qianlincd/). Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University.

My research interests include large-dimensional spectral algorithms, minimax rates of nonparametric regression problems, and sufficient dimension reduction.
