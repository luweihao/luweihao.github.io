About me
------
I am a Ph.D candidate at Department of Statistics and Data Science, Tsinghua University.
I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qian Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/qianlincd/)'s lab. 
Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University. 
I am broadly interested in large-dimensional spectral algorithms, minimax rates of noparametric regression problems, and sufficient dimension reduction.
